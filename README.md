Welcome to the server side to our project. This repository would encompass of a few things, particularly the following. To ease things, we have deployed out *MongoDB database* online, so all changes you see are realtime across all instance. 
1. Express App (API endpoints)
2. React Framework
3. Rainbow Bot Deployment

## How to Run


**To run the main app, proceed to do the following:**
1. Change current working directory to `./centralserver`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` or `node server.js`
4. Proceed to `https://localhost:3000/` for the magic

Take note that you might require a broswer that supports unverified HTTPS for the localhost version. Alternatively, you may visit the web-deployed version [here](https://poc-open-rainbow-swaggy.herokuapp.com/). Use the following credentials for login:
```
Username: admin@swaggy.com
Password: @Swaggy97
```

**To run the Dialog Flow Bot, proceed to do the following:**
1. Change current working directory to `./botnet/DialogFlowBot/`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` or `node index.js`

Due to the sensitivity with regards to API keys, we have instead chosen to deploy the  bot as well (via heroku). To check out the bot, login to the Rainbow interface [here](https://web-sandbox.openrainbow.com/app/1.70.5/index.html#/main/home) and look for the following bot with `email id: bot1@swaggy.com`


## Extras for APIs

We have also compiled our REST APIs online as such (including a runner). Do check it out [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10629994/Szf54UrQ?version=latest)
